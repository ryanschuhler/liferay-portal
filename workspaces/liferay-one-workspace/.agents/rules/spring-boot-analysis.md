# Spring Boot Static Analysis

`liferay-one-etc-spring-boot` holds 378 Java files. Before this change, one tool read them: the Liferay source formatter. That formatter checks the whitespace and the import order. No tool checked what the code does.

SpotBugs checks what the code does. SpotBugs runs as part of `check`, so `./gradlew build` runs it.

```bash
./gradlew :client-extensions:liferay-one-etc-spring-boot:spotbugsMain
```

SpotBugs writes the report to `build/reports/spotbugs/main.html`. It writes the XML report to the same folder.

## What It Is And Is Not

SpotBugs reads the bytecode. It therefore finds three kinds of defect that a reviewer does not see. The first is a charset that changes with the machine. The second is a static array that any caller can change. The third is a null check on a value that is never null.

SpotBugs does not find the most frequent defect in this client extension. [`concurrency.md`](./concurrency.md) describes shared mutable state on a singleton bean. Three examples are a `HashMap` in a field, a double-checked lock on a field that is not `volatile`, and one `SimpleDateFormat` that two threads use. SpotBugs reports only the most direct of these.

A reviewer works from `concurrency.md`. That file has a higher priority than this one.

## Configuration

`ignoreFailures` is on. SpotBugs therefore reports a finding, and the build still succeeds. Turn `ignoreFailures` off when the count reaches zero.

`spotbugs-exclude.xml` holds two exclusions:

- The `liferay-release-tool-ee` sources. Git checks these files into the source set of this project. This team does not own them.
- `EI_EXPOSE_REP` and `EI_EXPOSE_REP2`. These two rules report every getter that returns a mutable field. This project holds many DTOs, so these two rules report no defect.

SpotBugs reports every other rule. Add an exclusion only when a rule is incorrect for this project. Do not add an exclusion to hide a correct finding.

## What It Found

47 findings on the first run.

| Bug | Count | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY` | 23 | `final` protects the reference to an array, not the contents. Any caller can write into the array. A Spring singleton shares that array with every request. Return a `List.of(...)`, or return a copy. |
| `CT_CONSTRUCTOR_THROW` | 14 | A constructor throws after it builds part of the object. A finalizer can then read that incomplete object. |
| `DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING` | 5 | Read this finding first. The section below gives the reason. |
| `MS_EXPOSE_REP` | 2 | A method returns a static mutable field to a caller. |
| `RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE` | 1 | A null check reads a value that is never null. The code inside the check never runs. |
| `DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING` | 1 | The code calls `Integer.valueOf(s)`. The correct call is `Integer.parseInt(s)`. |

### The Encoding Findings

Three of the five `DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING` findings are in `getAuthorization`, `_getAuthorization`, and `_getAccessToken`. These three methods build the credentials for an outbound request.

A conversion from a string to bytes without a charset uses the default charset of the JVM. That default is UTF-8 on a developer machine. In production the default comes from the locale of the container.

A credential that holds a non-ASCII byte therefore produces different bytes in the two places. The request authenticates on the developer machine and fails after deployment. The stack trace gives no indication of the cause.

Name the charset. Write `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`.

## Ledger

| Finding | Open |
| --- | --- |
| `MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY` | 23 |
| `CT_CONSTRUCTOR_THROW` | 14 |
| `DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING` | 5 |
| `MS_EXPOSE_REP` | 2 |
| `RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE` | 1 |
| `DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING` | 1 |
| `SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE` | 1 |

Every rule applies to new code, whatever the count in this table says. The counts only decrease.
