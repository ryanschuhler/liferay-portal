# End-to-End Flows & Cross-Cutting Requirements

The per-surface files ([`routes.md`](./routes.md), [`rest.md`](./rest.md),
[`crons.md`](./crons.md), [`subscribers.md`](./subscribers.md),
[`services.md`](./services.md), [`converters.md`](./converters.md)) track the
**cheap unit coverage** — one row per code symbol, proven in isolation with
Vitest or JUnit + Mockito. This file tracks the **real, in-action coverage**:
the integration (`request` against a booted portal) and e2e (browser through
the custom element) tests that exercise those same symbols for real, as the
multi-surface user journeys they belong to.

Journeys use `spec:` Source anchors, which `checkPlan` intentionally does not
enumerate — curate these rows by hand. Each journey names the [LPD-87600](https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPD-87600)
Epic (E01–E26, with gaps) and, where known, the specific story that owns it, in parentheses
in the Requirement column, so the plan traces back to the platform-launch
initiative.

> **Ticket tagging (LPD-87600).** The One Liferay Platform launch is initiative
> [LPD-87600](https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LPD-87600). Its ~30 Epics map
> onto the journeys below: E04/E05 + E07 (provisioning/trials), E09/E10 (project
> management), E11 (Salesforce), E13/E14 (support UI), E15 (account/org/identity),
> E16 (admin UI), E18 (marketplace/product discovery), E20 (utilization), E25
> (Stripe tax). The per-surface files reference the same Epics in their
> Requirement text where a row belongs to a distinct feature area.

Most journeys are implemented in code but cannot run end to end against a local
environment yet. Two structural blockers dominate:

- **No `/o/one/v1` proxy locally.** The Spring Boot endpoints enforce OAuth2
  scopes through a proxy path the local portal does not expose, so the
  positive-path REST tests cannot authenticate. Only the unauthenticated
  negative path and `/ready` are reachable directly at `:58081`.
- **External systems and seeded data.** The journeys read from or write to Jira,
  Google Cloud Storage, Salesforce Pub/Sub, Okta, and the provisioning/console
  backends, or need seeded commerce data, or need a user provisioned with an
  entitlement the seed admin lacks (the gated page groups render the Restricted
  Page for `test@liferay.com`).

Such journeys are marked `deferred` with the precise blocker, so they stay
tracked without dragging down the go-live denominator. Requirements that are
provable locally today are `planned` and carry a real test.

Journeys marked **spec-not-staged** are documented here (step 1: every coded
flow is at least captured) but do not yet have an authored integration/e2e spec
in `integration/specs` or `e2e/specs`; they were added when the code surface for
trials, projects, organizations, Okta identity sync, license keys, tax, and AI
Hub landed. Staging their specs is tracked follow-up work. Every other deferred
journey below is **already authored** as a full integration or e2e spec, wrapped
in `test.describe.fixme` so it is collected and skipped rather than run. Each
authored spec's header documents the exact blocker and the environment variables
to set; the spec name is listed in the journey's Requirement.

Unblocking is not purely environmental: several deferred specs lean on
positional or broad-regex selectors (`getByRole('button').last()`,
`selectOption({index: 1})`, `getByText(/order|confirmation|success/i)`) that
were written before the UI could be exercised. Harden these to role/label/test-id
selectors as each journey is enabled, or they will flake or false-pass. The
order-dependent journeys (business-event create→edit→delete, Salesforce
upsert→dedupe→deactivate) are already pinned with `test.describe.configure({mode:
'serial'})` so a failed first step skips the rest instead of cascading.

> **Out-of-scan surface.** The `liferay-one-etc-cron` client extension ships as a
> prebuilt jar (`dist/liferay-one-etc-cron.zip`) with no source in this
> workspace, so its scheduled tasks are **not enumerated** by `checkPlan` and are
> **not** tracked as rows. Its sibling in `liferay-marketplace-workspace`
> (`MarketplaceCommandLineRunner`) runs trial processing, pending-order
> completion, most-purchased-products aggregation, Koroneiki project linking,
> publisher sales-summary aggregation, and feedback requests — treat the One
> `etc-cron` as covering the same class of scheduled jobs until its source is
> vendored here and can be scanned.

## Authentication & Access

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUTH-UNAUTHENTICATED | Every Spring Boot endpoint rejects an unauthenticated caller with 401 before any controller or outbound Jira/GCS/commerce call runs, except the five the exclude list makes public (`/ready`, `/invitations/accept`, and three `/cloud/…` paths), which assert the inverse and so pin that list in place. Because the filter chain answers 401 on any path, each route is also probed with PATCH — a verb no controller maps — so a 405 with its Allow header proves the route exists rather than merely 404ing into a 401 (LPD-87600 platform) | integration | P0 | planned | spec:auth#unauthenticated-rejected |
| AUTH-OAUTH2-SCOPES | Deferred — positive-path scope enforcement (`customer.read`, `ticket.read`, `ticket.write`, …) returns 403 on a valid token missing the scope; needs an OAuth2 app to mint a scoped token and the local portal does not expose the `/o/one/v1` proxy path. Staged: `integration/specs/oauth2Scopes.spec.ts` (E15, LPD-88258) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:auth#oauth2-scope-enforcement |
| FLOW-RESTRICTED-PAGE | Entitlement-gated page groups (Admin, My Account) mount the SPA but render the Restricted Page view for a user without the entitlement — proves the custom element mounts and routes in-browser and the access gate holds (LPD-92707, LPD-92706) | e2e | P1 | planned | spec:flow#restricted-page |
| FLOW-SPA-RENDER-SMOKE | Every custom-element route across all seven page groups mounts the `liferay-one-custom-element` web component and renders a first header or visible content (gated groups render the restricted view, missing-data routes render an empty state) — a fresh-local health check that the React app boots and renders on every route, runnable today against a spun-up local with the seed admin. Implemented: `e2e/specs/customElementRender.spec.ts` (E06, LPD-88260) | e2e | P1 | planned | spec:flow#spa-render-smoke |

## Role-Based Access Control (LPD-95398)

The LPD-95398 permissions matrix — what each account-level and project-level role may view (👁), act on (✅), or is denied (❌) across the Account Management area. Every row drives `e2e/specs/rolePermissionsMatrix.spec.ts`, one `test` per matrix cell.

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-ROLE-ACCOUNT-PERMISSIONS | Deferred — needs users provisioned with each account role (Account Admin, Partner Account Admin, Account Buyer, Account Member, null) on a shared account; the seed admin sees the Restricted Page. Enforces the account-level matrix (LPD-95398): Account Details edit gated to admins, Account Members hidden from a Buyer-only user, Orders denied to a null role, Projects denied to Buyer/null. Staged: `e2e/specs/rolePermissionsMatrix.spec.ts` (E15, LPD-88258) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#role-account-permissions |
| FLOW-ROLE-PROJECT-PERMISSIONS | Deferred — needs users provisioned with each project role (Project Admin, Project Requester, Project User) plus an Account Admin, all assigned to a shared project. Enforces the project-level matrix (LPD-95398): project details view for all, member management gated to Admins, Business Events / Ticket Attachments / support-ticket submission full for Requester and view-only for Project User. Staged: `e2e/specs/rolePermissionsMatrix.spec.ts` (E09/E10, LPD-88261/LPD-88252) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#role-project-permissions |
| FLOW-ROLE-NULL-PROJECT-ACCESS | Deferred — needs a null-role user with no project membership and a second null-role user assigned to one project. Enforces the null-role project-access rules (LPD-95398): account-level pages only when unassigned, account-level plus the assigned project when assigned, and an unassigned project is not displayed in navigation. Staged: `e2e/specs/rolePermissionsMatrix.spec.ts` (LPD-92707) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#role-null-project-access |

## Commerce: Purchase, Checkout & Entitlements

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-PRODUCT-PURCHASE-ENTRY | Deferred — needs an entitled user with a purchasable product; the seed admin sees the Restricted Page. Drives the ProductPurchase wizard (`ROUTE-PRODUCT-PURCHASE-*`) from account selection through summary; the wizard branches per product type (DXP, LDP, CMP, DSR, AI Hub), so it also exercises the GA purchase/provisioning epics. Staged: `e2e/specs/productPurchase.spec.ts` (E18, LPD-88250; GA products: DSR LPD-79893, CMP LPD-82399, LDP LPD-95794) | e2e | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#product-purchase-entry |
| FLOW-CHECKOUT-FREE | Deferred — needs an entitled user and commerce completion. Free-app checkout completes a CommerceOrder and triggers entitlement generation (`REST-POST-ENTITLEMENTS-GENERATE`). Staged: `e2e/specs/productPurchase.spec.ts` (E18, LPD-88250; GA products: DSR LPD-79893, CMP LPD-82399, LDP LPD-95794) | e2e | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#checkout-free |
| FLOW-CHECKOUT-PAID | Deferred — needs an entitled user and a payment-provider stub. Paid-app checkout adds the license and payment-method steps and reaches payment before completing the order. Staged: `e2e/specs/productPurchase.spec.ts` (E18, LPD-88250; tokens via Stripe MIT, LPD-93643; GA products: DSR LPD-79893, CMP LPD-82399, LDP LPD-95794) | e2e | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#checkout-paid |
| FLOW-TAX-CALCULATION | Spec-not-staged — `REST-POST-COMMERCE-ORDERS-COMMERCEORDERID-CALCULATE-TAX` applies the tax-applicability rules (`SVC-COMMERCEORDERSERVICE`: business account taxed only when billed to Ireland; person account across the European country set; untaxed otherwise) to a CommerceOrder; the rule branches are unit-covered, the in-action path needs a seeded order behind the proxy (E25, LPD-88264) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#tax-calculation |
| FLOW-AI-HUB-PURCHASE | Spec-not-staged — AI Hub purchase wizard (`ROUTE-PRODUCT-PURCHASE-AI-HUB-FORM`, `…-AI-HUB-OPEN-BETA-FORM`) completes an order, the `ai/hub/tokens` object action grants tokens, and `AIHubService` provisions the tenant; needs an entitled user + AI Hub backend stub (LPD-90605) | e2e | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#ai-hub-purchase |
| FLOW-ENTITLEMENT-GENERATION | Deferred — needs seeded commerce order items (the controller branch is unit-covered). Generates one Entitlement per EntitlementDefinition, idempotently, via `REST-POST-ENTITLEMENTS-GENERATE` and the commerce-order-item object action. Staged: `integration/specs/entitlementGeneration.spec.ts` (LPD-89424, LPD-89274) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#entitlement-generation |
| FLOW-SALESFORCE-ORDER-SYNC | Deferred — inbound Salesforce Pub/Sub upsert; needs a broker/stub. `SalesforceObjectPubsubSubscriber` upserts Commerce price entries, products, and SKUs idempotently and dedupes duplicates; `SalesforceOpportunityPubsubSubscriber` upserts the order/contract from an opportunity event; both handlers are unit-covered. Staged: `integration/specs/salesforceOrderSync.spec.ts` (E11, LPD-88254) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#salesforce-order-sync |

## Account, Organizations & Identity

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-MY-ACCOUNT-OVERVIEW | Deferred — projects, orders, and billing render for an entitled member; the seed admin sees the Restricted Page. Drives the MyAccount route group (`ROUTE-MY-ACCOUNT-*`). Staged: `e2e/specs/myAccount.spec.ts` (E15, LPD-88258; E10, LPD-88252) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#my-account-overview |
| FLOW-ACCOUNT-TEAM-MEMBERS | Deferred — needs an invite flow and member data. Account team invite, assign-role, and remove on `ROUTE-MY-ACCOUNT-ACCOUNT-MEMBERS`, with role enforcement, via the `accounts/{erc}/user-accounts*` endpoints. Staged: `e2e/specs/myAccount.spec.ts` (E15, LPD-88258) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#account-team-members |
| FLOW-ACCOUNT-PROVISIONING | Spec-not-staged — the account object actions (`REST-POST-OBJECT-ACTION-ACCOUNT-CREATE`/`-UPDATE`/`-DELETE`) provision, mutate, and tear down an account and its downstream records (contacts, addresses, JSM sync) idempotently; needs the proxy + seeded objects (E15, LPD-88258) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#account-provisioning |
| FLOW-ORGANIZATION-SYNC | Spec-not-staged — organization object actions and the `organizations/*` endpoints create/update/delete an organization, assign account and organization-role memberships, and mirror to JSM (`…/sync-to-jsm`) and Okta (`…/sync-from-okta`); needs the proxy + JSM/Okta stubs (E15, LPD-88258, LPD-89425) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#organization-sync |
| FLOW-OKTA-IDENTITY-SYNC | Spec-not-staged — inbound Okta Pub/Sub (`SUB-OKTAUSERSPUBSUBSUBSCRIBER`, `SUB-OKTAAPPCREATEDPUBSUBSUBSCRIBER`) and the `user-accounts/{userId}/sync-with-okta` endpoint upsert Liferay users and org-role associations idempotently; the handlers are unit-covered, the in-action path needs a Pub/Sub broker + Okta stub (E15, LPD-88258, LPD-89425) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#okta-identity-sync |

## Project Management (E09/E10)

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-PROJECT-LIFECYCLE | Spec-not-staged — a project is created and its scoped pages (products, applications, orders, downloads, business events) render for a member; drives `ROUTE-MY-ACCOUNT-PROJECT*` and the project-scoped Jira business-events endpoints (`/jira/projects/{erc}/...`); needs an entitled member + seeded project (E09/E10, LPD-88261/LPD-88252) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#project-lifecycle |
| FLOW-PROJECT-MEMBERSHIP | Spec-not-staged — project member management on `ROUTE-MY-ACCOUNT-PROJECT-MEMBERS`: add/remove a member and assign a project role via `projects/{projectId}/user-accounts/{userId}/account-roles`, with `ProjectMembershipService` guarding duplicates and orphan rows; needs a provisioned member + project (E09/E10, LPD-88261/LPD-88252) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#project-membership |

## Licensing & Subscriptions

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-LICENSE-GENERATION | Deferred — needs subscription data and the signer. Generates a signed license key tied to a subscription (`CommonLicenseKeyService`, ported KeyGeneratorImpl/LicenseKeyExporter). Staged: `integration/specs/licenseLifecycle.spec.ts` (LPD-89421/LPD-89422/LPD-89423) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#license-generation |
| FLOW-LICENSE-FREE-KEY | Spec-not-staged — free license issuance: `REST-POST-LICENSE-KEYS-TYPE-FREE` mints a free key after `…-TYPE-FREE-DOMAINS-CHECK` validates the domain, and `GET /license-keys/{licenseKeyId}/download` streams it; needs subscription/domain seed data (LPD-89423, LPD-89429) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#license-free-key |
| FLOW-SUBSCRIPTION-LICENSE-SYNC | Spec-not-staged — the `license-keys/subscriptions` GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints and `common-license-keys` create keep SubscriptionEntry and CommonLicenseKey in sync with provisioning; needs the proxy + migrated subscription data (LPD-89420/LPD-89427/LPD-89428) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#subscription-license-sync |
| FLOW-LICENSE-EXPIRATION-EMAIL | Deferred — the expiry cron (`CRON-SCHEDULEDSENDEXPIRINGLICENSEKEYEMAILS`) queues 30/14/0-day templated emails per subscribed user; the cron body is unit-covered in `SubscriptionEntryServiceTest`. Staged: `integration/specs/licenseLifecycle.spec.ts` (LPD-89428) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#license-expiration-email |
| FLOW-LICENSE-REVOCATION | Spec-only — no license-key revocation endpoint or action is implemented yet. Staged: `integration/specs/licenseLifecycle.spec.ts` (LPD-89428) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#license-revocation |

## Support: Tickets & Business Events (E13/E14)

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-BUSINESS-EVENT-LIFECYCLE | Deferred — business events are backed by Jira Assets; needs a Jira stub. Create, edit, delete, and activity-history across `ROUTE-BUSINESS-EVENTS-*` and the project-scoped JiraRestController business-events CRUD, versions, field options, and project object-key endpoints. Staged: `e2e/specs/businessEvents.spec.ts` (E13/E14, LPD-88255) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#business-event-lifecycle |
| FLOW-TICKET-UPLOAD | Deferred — needs Jira and GCS stubs. Attachment upload initiates a GCS resumable session (`REST-POST-TICKET-ATTACHMENTS-INITIATE-UPLOAD`), completes with an MD5 check and posts a Jira comment (`…-COMPLETE-UPLOAD`), with the draft-comment retry cron (`CRON-SCHEDULEDUPDATETICKETATTACHMENTDRAFTCOMMENTBODY`) as fallback; drives `ROUTE-TICKET-ATTACHMENTS-NEW*` and the upload access check. Staged: `e2e/specs/ticketUpload.spec.ts` (E13/E14, LPD-88255) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#ticket-attachment-upload |
| FLOW-TICKET-DOWNLOAD | Deferred — needs a GCS stub. Signed-URL download (≤15 min expiry) enforces member vs non-member access checks (`REST-GET-TICKETS-…-DOWNLOAD-ACCESS-CHECK`, by-id and by-ERC download); non-member → 403, missing → 404. Staged: `integration/specs/ticketAttachmentDownload.spec.ts` (E13/E14, LPD-88255) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#ticket-attachment-download |
| FLOW-TICKET-ATTACHMENT-RETENTION | Deferred — needs Jira and GCS stubs. Attachment retention lifecycle: `scheduledCleanUp` trashes attachments on tickets closed more than 7 days ago (`CRON-SCHEDULEDCLEANUP`) and `scheduledDeleteTicketAttachment` drains the trash to a GCS hard-delete (`CRON-SCHEDULEDDELETETICKETATTACHMENT`), idempotently. Staged: `integration/specs/ticketAttachmentRetention.spec.ts` (E13/E14, LPD-88255) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#ticket-attachment-retention |

## Publisher (E18)

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-PUBLISHER-ONBOARDING | Deferred — needs an entitled publisher user and a GCS stub for logo/asset upload. Publisher edits the profile and uploads a logo, then views published apps, published solutions, and the sales summary across `ROUTE-PUBLISHER-DASHBOARD-*`. Staged: `e2e/specs/publisherDashboard.spec.ts` (E18, LPD-88250) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#publisher-onboarding |

## Admin, Trials & Provisioning (E07/E16/E20)

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-ADMIN-DASHBOARD | Deferred — the Marketplace admin dashboard renders for entitled staff; the seed admin is not entitled and sees the Restricted Page. Drives the Admin route group (`ROUTE-ADMIN-*`): tables paginate/sort/filter, inline edit, and non-admin rejection. Staged: `e2e/specs/adminDashboard.spec.ts` (E16, LPD-88257) | e2e | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#admin-dashboard |
| FLOW-TRIAL-PROVISIONING | Deferred — trial provisioning is now implemented (`REST-POST-TRIALPROVISIONING-ORDERID`, `…-TRIALPROVISIONING`, `CRON-SCHEDULEDPROCESSTRIALS`, `Provisioning*Service`). Availability and domain checks (`REST-GET-TRIALAVAILABILITY`, `…-TRIALDOMAIN-AVAILABILITY-PROJECTPREFIX`) gate the start; provisioning creates the tenant. Needs the provisioning/console backend stub. Staged: `integration/specs/trialProvisioning.spec.ts` (E07, LPD-88259; LPD-97677 Phase 1 provisioning) | integration | P0 | deferred | spec:flow#trial-provisioning |
| FLOW-TRIAL-EXPIRY | Deferred — trial expiry/extension is now implemented (`REST-POST-TRIALEXPIRE-ORDERID`, `…-TRIALEXTEND-ID`, `DELETE /trial{orderId}`, and the expiry/notify branches of `CRON-SCHEDULEDPROCESSTRIALS`). Needs the provisioning backend stub + seeded trials. Staged: `integration/specs/trialProvisioning.spec.ts` (E07, LPD-88259) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#trial-expiry |

## Utilization, Console & Publisher Analytics (E07/E18/E20)

Adjacent flows surfaced by auditing the sibling `liferay-customer-workspace` and
`liferay-marketplace-workspace`, whose code has close analogs in One (some of it
in the unscannable `liferay-one-etc-cron`). Captured so no coded flow is
undocumented; all are **spec-not-staged**.

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-CONSOLE-ANALYTICS-PROVISIONING | Spec-not-staged — after a trial/purchase completes, `SVC-CONSOLESERVICE` and `SVC-ANALYTICSCLOUDSERVICE` provision the console project and Analytics Cloud workspace and `ProvisioningAssignmentService` wires roles/Okta groups, driving `ROUTE-PRODUCT-PURCHASE-PROVISIONING`; the service branches are unit-covered, the in-action path needs the console/analytics backend stub (E07, LPD-88259; E20, LPD-88249) | integration | P1 | deferred | spec:flow#console-analytics-provisioning |
| FLOW-UTILIZATION-TRACKING | Spec-not-staged — project resource utilization/overage is computed and rendered in the project item detail (`buildUtilizationSections`, `resolveUtilizationProfile`) per the E20 profile; there is no backend utilization object yet, so this is a frontend-only Vitest target on the utilization builder plus an e2e render check once an entitled member is provisioned (E20, LPD-88249) | unit | P2 | deferred | spec:flow#utilization-tracking |
| FLOW-PUBLISHER-SALES-SUMMARY | Spec-not-staged — publisher paid orders aggregate into quarterly sales summaries and render on the Publisher Dashboard via `PublisherSalesSummaries` on `ROUTE-PUBLISHER-DASHBOARD-*`; the aggregation job lives in the unscannable `liferay-one-etc-cron` (analog: marketplace `MarketplaceCommandLineRunner._processPublisherSalesSummary`), so only the SPA render is testable here until that source is vendored (E18, LPD-88250) | e2e | P2 | deferred | spec:flow#publisher-sales-summary |

## Not-Yet-Built Epics (phase-completion tracking)

Epics under LPD-87600 whose runtime feature has **no code in the two client
extensions yet**. Unlike the deferred journeys above — which are implemented but
cannot run locally — these are `planned` on purpose so they sit in the go-live
denominator, each covered only by a `test.fixme` stub in `pendingFlows.spec.ts`.
`plan:report` therefore classifies them **⏳ pending** (counted, not real), so the
GO-LIVE (real) percentage measures how much of the phase is actually finished:
when each epic lands, replace its stub with a real test and the number climbs.

| ID | Requirement | Type | Priority | Status | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLOW-CONSUMPTION-METERING | Not built yet — per-account and per-project usage is metered and aggregated into billable consumption records on the billing cycle. Pending stub: `integration/specs/pendingFlows.spec.ts` (E24, LPD-88265) | integration | P0 | planned | spec:flow#consumption-metering |
| FLOW-CONSUMPTION-BILLING | Not built yet — aggregated consumption converts to Stripe charges/invoice lines, with overage above the plan allowance billed and idempotent on re-run. Pending stub: `integration/specs/pendingFlows.spec.ts` (E24, LPD-88265) | integration | P0 | planned | spec:flow#consumption-billing |
| FLOW-MULTI-CURRENCY-CHECKOUT | Not built yet — catalog prices and checkout totals render in the account's currency and the resulting CommerceOrder persists that currency. Pending stub: `e2e/specs/pendingFlows.spec.ts` (E26, LPD-88263) | e2e | P1 | planned | spec:flow#multi-currency-checkout |
| FLOW-LOCALIZATION | Not built yet — the custom element renders localized labels and formats per the user's locale across the page groups. Pending stub: `e2e/specs/pendingFlows.spec.ts` (E26, LPD-88263) | e2e | P1 | planned | spec:flow#localization |

## Surface coverage matrix

Proof that the journeys above collectively exercise every unit-tested surface in
action. This table is informational — `checkPlan` does not parse it (it is not
a six-column plan table). "Status" is the real-test status, not the unit-test
status; every surface here already has unit coverage in its per-surface file.

| `CRON-SCHEDULEDASSETOBJECTSCACHEEVICTION` | — (internal Spring cache evict; no user journey) | ⚠ unit-only | n/a — not a user journey |
| `object/action/user/delete` (subscription cleanup cascade) | — (internal object action; no user journey) | ⚠ unit-only | n/a — not a user journey |

Two surfaces have no in-action journey by design — a Spring cache eviction and an
internal user-delete cascade are pure mechanics with no user-facing flow, so unit
coverage is sufficient. Everything else is exercised by a journey above and is
unblocked by the same environment work: a provisioning fixture that grants the
test user the gating entitlement/role, an OAuth2 app for scoped tokens behind a
local `/o/one/v1` proxy, and external-system stubs (Jira, GCS, Salesforce
Pub/Sub, Okta, provisioning/console) or seeded commerce data.
