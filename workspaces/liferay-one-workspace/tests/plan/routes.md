# Routes

Every custom-element SPA route. The SPA mounts one of seven page-group routers (chosen by the host widget's `route` attribute); six carry nested route tables enumerated below, and the seventh (account-selector) is a single page with no nested routes. Most route groups are static route tables, covered by Vitest route-wiring unit tests that assert the declared paths, elements, and titles. Route groups with conditional wiring (e.g. ProductPurchase's free/paid steps) additionally warrant an e2e test that loads the route and asserts it renders for the right persona. A few routes are declared inline in the *Router.tsx files rather than the static table (the MyAccount account guard and project layout, the ProductPurchase completion pages); these only render behind entitlement or commerce state, so they are e2e/deferred and exercised by the flows in flows.md.
